# Instagram utilities

Unfollowing, following, liking, and more can be automated on Instagram's web interface using Selenium.

To run, make sure you have the correct driver for your browser. By default, the driver in this repo is for chrome. To find information about other drivers, please visit https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html

## TODO 
- create app for following
- create app for liking
- research other functionality that could be automated (posting specifically but not sure if this works from web)
- increase the unfollow limit; currently stuck at 12 because Xpath changes when more followers are loaded
- once more apps are built, consolidate them in to one app with better user experience 
- possibly make this into a `haxor-news` style application
